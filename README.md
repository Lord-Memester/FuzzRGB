I want to actually own all the parts of my profile picture, so I made this to practice Python and to make a new background for it that I unquestionably would.

**The code in this repository made no use of generative AI. I said I'd do it right this time, and I try to keep my promises.**

# FuzzRGB
## How do I use it?
In command prompt or a terminal: 
```bash
python FuzzRGB.py
```
The program will prompt you to input your desired image dimensions. It will generate the image and save it in the directory from which it was run.
## Requirements
If you do not have `numpy` or `pillow`, you must install them.
